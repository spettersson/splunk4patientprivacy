### 🔍 Detections  
A collection of detections designed to work together to surface staff members and patients with elevated risk — potentially indicating a privacy or security incident. Detections are organized into two categories:

- **Event-based detections** –  Correlate events to identify intermediate findings that reflects a notable behavior. An observation may not be an incident on its own, but it’s worth tracking.
- **Finding-based detections** – Group related observations and assess risk to generate findings. A finding is a higher-confidence alert that may indicate an actual incident.

### 📊 Dashboards
