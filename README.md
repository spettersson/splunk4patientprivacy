# Splunk Patient Privacy Content

Welcome to the Splunk Patient Privacy Content.

This project will provide access to patient privacy content to help harness the power of the market-leading SIEM **Splunk Enterprise Security** to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data, and ensure policy compliance. 

### 📌 What Type Of Content You Will Find Here

#### 🔍 Detections  
A collection of detections designed to work together to surface staff members and patients with elevated risk — potentially indicating a privacy or security incident. Detections are organized into two categories:

  - **Event-based detections** –  Correlate events and logs to identify intermediate findings that reflect notable behavior. These findings represent activity that may not be an incident on its own.
  - **Finding-based detections** – Group intermediate findings and assess risk to generate finding groups. A finding group is a higher-confidence alert that potentially could be an incident.

#### 📊 Dashboards  
Prebuilt Splunk dashboards that complement the out-of-box dashboards provided by Splunk Enterprise Security.
