# 🛡️ Protecting Patient Privacy with Splunk

The purpose of this repository is to help organizations harness the power of **Splunk** to protect patient privacy by detecting and investigating potentially inappropriate access to medical records.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

### 🔍 Detections  
Detections built to work together to identify staff members and patients with high risk. They fall into two categories:

- **Observation Triggering** – Searching and correlates events to identify observations, where each observation indicated an interesting behaviour.
- **Alert Triggering** – Groups observations over time and makes a risk assessment, raising high-confidence alerts.

### 📊 Dashboards  
Prebuilt Splunk dashboards for visualizing, reviewing, and investigating observations and alerts.
