# 🛡️ Protecting Patient Privacy with Splunk

The purpose of this repository is to help organizations harness the power of **Splunk** to protect patient privacy by detecting and investigating potentially inappropriate access to medical records.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

### 🔍 Detections  
Detections designed to work together to identify staff and patients with elevated risk that may potentially indicate an incident. They fall into two categories:

- **Observation Triggering** – Correlates events to detect observations, where each observation reflect a notable behaviour.
- **Alert Triggering** – Aggregates observations and assesses risk, to generate high-fidelity alerts.

### 📊 Dashboards  
Prebuilt Splunk dashboards for visualizing, reviewing, and investigating observations and alerts.
