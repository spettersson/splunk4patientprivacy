name: Unusual Access Hours
type: Observation Triggering
description: Looks for staff members accessing patient medical records during unusual hours of the day, based on historical access pattern. 
          Access is considered unusual if it occurs during an hour that is rare or not previously observed for the individual staff member. 
          For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation.

prerequisites:
- data sources:
          EHR audit events from any source
- tags:
          auditevent (=identifies all EHR audit events, regardless of source system)
          patientrecord (=identifies all EHR audit events associated with patient records access, regardless of source system)
- indexes: 
          observation (=where identified observations are stored as individual events)
- lookups: 
          baseline_access_hours
- fields: 
          user_id
          patient_id
          care_provider_id
- searches: 
          search_1
          search_2
how_to_implement:
search_1: 
- title: 
- description: This search creates and maintains a baseline of access hours to patient medical records for each staff member. 
          It identifies the least commonly used hours (rare) by user and stores the results in a lookup table (baseline_access_hours) 
          for further use in search_2 to detect anomalies.
- search: tag=auditevent tag=patientrecord earliest=-30d
          | fields _time, user_id
          | eval hourOfDay = strftime(_time, "%H")
          | rare hourOfDay by user_id
          | fields user_id, hourOfDay, percent
          | outputlookup baseline_access_hours
- earliest_time: Leave empty (defined in search via earliest option).
- latest_time: Leave empty (defined in search via latest option).

search_2: 
- title: 
- description: This search runs continuously to detect accesses to patient records during hours that are unusual for the staff 
          member, based on the baseline built by search_1. If an access occurs at a rare or previously unseen hour 
          (percent â‰¤ 1 or null), an observation is created and stored in the index=observation.
