description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to update the history of what staff member has accessed what patient medical 
          record, and when, and removes any history older than 6 month. The updated history is stored in 
          the lookup file baseline_historical_access.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and medicalrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, and care_provider_id, as well. Moreover, it is 
          recommended to first run the search included in '1_baseline_backfill_first_seen_access.yaml' to get 
          the full 6 month history.
