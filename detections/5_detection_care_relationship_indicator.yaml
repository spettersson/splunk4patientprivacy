description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect clinical signals that indicate a legitimate 
          care relationship between staff members and patients. This can act as valuable evidence when 
          assessing whether a staff memberâ€™s access to patient records is legitimate.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=auditevent action=sign
          | fields user_id, patient_id, care_department_id, care_unit_id, care_provider_id 
          | stats count values(care_department_id) as care_department_id values(care_unit_id) as care_unit_id values(care_provider_id) as care_provider_id by user_id, patient_id

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags medication, diagnostic, 
          procedure, and encounter. The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, care_unit_id, 
          care_provider_id, type, subtype, and status, as well.
