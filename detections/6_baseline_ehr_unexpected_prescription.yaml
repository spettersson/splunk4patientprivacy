description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to identify typical activities that precede 
          a staff member prescribing medication to a patient â€” such as fulfilled appointments and 
          completed encounters. These activities are saved as individual events in a summary index. 
          This enables efficient correlation between recent prescriptions and historical context, 
          which is leveraged in the 6_ehr_unexpected_prescription search.
