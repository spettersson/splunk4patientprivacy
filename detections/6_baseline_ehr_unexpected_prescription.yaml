description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to identify activities that would normally happen before 
          a staff member prescribes medication to a patient â€” such as appointments and encounters. 
          These activities are saved as individual events in a summary index. This approach allow us to efficently
          correlate recent prescriptions with historical activities, which is done in the search in 
          6_ehr_unexpected_prescription.
