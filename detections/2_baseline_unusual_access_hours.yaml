description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to identify the least common hours of the day that staff members access 
          patient medical records. The result is stored in the lookup file baseline_access_hours.
data_source: EHR audit data from any source
search: tag=auditevent
          | fields _time, user_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | eval hourOfDay = strftime(_time, "%H")
          | rare hourOfDay by user_id, care_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | fields user_id, hourOfDay, percent, work_unit_id, care_provider_id

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and medicalrecord. 
          The data must have the field user_id, as well.
