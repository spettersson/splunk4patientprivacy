description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect role changes made to staff members in Cambio Cosmic. This 
        includes events such as addition or removal of roles, as well as temporary or permanent function-based
        access associated with an existing role. In a healthcare environment, staff member should only have access to 
        what is required to perform its duties. Therefore, monitoring role changes is critical to ensure compliance 
        with access control policies and to identify potential signs of unauthorized or inappropriate access. 
        The surfaced role changes can be correlated with other observations to support the detection of access 
        misuse or security incidents.
