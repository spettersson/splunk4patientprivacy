description: This search runs continuously to detect staff members that access a high volume of distinct patient 
          medical records in a short time period compared to their peers.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=auditevent tag=patientrecord earliest=-30d
          | fields _time, user_id, patient_id, department_id, care_provider_id
          | bin _time span=1h
          | stats dc(patient_id) as dc_patient by _time, user_id, department_id, care_provider_id
          | eventstats perc95(dc_patient) as perc95_dc_patient by department_id, care_provider_id
          | where _time > relative_time(_time, "-1h")
          | where dc_patient > perc95_dc_patient
          | fields user_id, department_id, care_provider_id,  dc_patient
how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, department_id, and care_provider_id, as well.
