status: experimental
description: This search establishes a history of what staff member has accessed what patient medical 
          record, and when, for the past 6 months.
data_source:
search: tag=auditevent tag=patientrecord earliest=-6mon latest=now
          | fields _time, user_id, patient_id
          | stats latest(_time) as last_access by user_id, patient_id
          | table user_id, patient_id, last_access
          | outputlookup baseline_historical_access
how_to_implement: Run this search once to get the 6 month history, then implement '1_baseline_first_seen_access' to ensure that
          the history is incrementally updated on a daily basis.
