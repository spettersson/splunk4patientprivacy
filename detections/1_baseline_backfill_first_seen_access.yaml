type: Baseline
status: experimental
description: This search establishes a history of what staff member has accessed what patient medical 
          record, and when, during the last 6 months. The history is stored in the lookup file baseline_historical_access.
data_source:
search: tag=auditevent tag=patientrecord earliest=-6mon latest=now
          | fields _time, user_id, patient_id
          | stats latest(_time) as last_access by user_id, patient_id
          | table user_id, patient_id, last_access
          | outputlookup baseline_historical_access
how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id and patient_id, as well. Moreover, this search should only be run once to
          populate the history.
