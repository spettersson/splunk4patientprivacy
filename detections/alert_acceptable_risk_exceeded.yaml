name: Risk Threshold Exceeded
type: Alert Triggering
description: This detection groups observations from the past 24 hours by staff_ID and patient_ID, and aggregates 
          the total risk_score contributed by each. When the cumulative risk score for a specific employee or patient exceeds 
          100, an alert is generated and stored as an event in the alert_collection index. 
detection_ID: ale1
prerequisites: 
- indexes: 
          observation_collection (=where identified observations are stored as individual events)
          alert_collection (=where triggered alerts are stored as individual events)
- fields: 
          staff_ID 
          patient_ID
          risk_score
          detection_ID
          observation_ID
- searches: 
          search 1
how_to_implement:
          1. create an index called 'observation_collection' and 'incident_collection'. 
          2. create 'search 1' as a report and then schedule it according to the instructions.
