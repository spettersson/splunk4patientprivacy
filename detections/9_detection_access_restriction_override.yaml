description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members who initiate an override
          of an internal or external access restriction. An override should only occur either 
          upon a patientâ€™s request or in emergency situations. Thus, such events should be correlated with 
          other such events observations to validate its legitimacy.
