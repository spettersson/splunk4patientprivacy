description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members accessing patient medical records 
          during hours that are unusual — meaning activity that occurs during times making up ≤ 1% of 
          their normal pattern, or not at all. This is done by leveraging the baseline created by 
          baseline_unusual_access_hours.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=auditevent
          | fields user_id, patient_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | eval hourOfDay = strftime(_time, "%H")
          | stats count by hourOfDay, user_id, patient_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | lookup baseline_access_hours user_id hourOfDay OUTPUT percent AS historical_percent
          | where isnull(historical_percent) OR historical_percent<=1
          | fields user_id, patient_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id, hourOfDay, historical_percent

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and medicalrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, and care_provider_id, as well. Moreover, in order for the search
          to work, the lookup file baseline_access_hours needs to be populated which is done running 2_baseline_unusual_access_hours.
