name: first seen access
type: anomaly-triggering
description:
          This detection looks for employees who recently accessed a patient medical record
          without having any prior history with that paitent in the last 6 months. For each match, an anomaly is triggered.
detection_ID: anomaly1
prerequisites:
- data_sources: 
    Audit Logs from any Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system that records staff access to patient medical records.
- tags:
    emraudit (explanation: A standardized tag used to identify all EMR audit logs, regardless of source system. These logs contain details about staff interactions with patient medical records.)
- indexes: 
    anomaly_collection (explanation: an index where identified anomalies are stored as individual events.)
- lookups: 
    baseline_historical_access (a lookup file that stores the last seen access between employees and patients.)
- fields: 
    staff_ID (mandatory; a unique identifier for the employee that is consistent across all EMR systems, for example HSA-id or government-issued id.)
    patient_ID (mandatory; a unique identifier for the patient that is consistent across all EMR systems.)
    care_unit_ID (optional)
    work_unit_ID (optional)
    care_provider_ID (optional)
    
- searches: 
    search_1
    search_2
    search_3

how_to_implement:
  1. fields:
      - Make sure each individual EMR system has, at minimum, the following fields: staff_ID, patient_ID

  2. indexes:
      - Make sure that an index with the name 'alert_collection' exist.
      - The retention for this index should be configured according to your requirements/needs. 
      
  4. lookups:
      - Download and install Splunk App for Lookup File Editing (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724).
      - Create a KVstore lookup with the name 'baseline_historical_access' with the fields: staff_ID, patient_ID, last_access
      Import the lookup baseline_historical_access.csv 
        (https://github.com/spettersson/splunk4patientprivacy/blob/cc1ba2159eadc166eee0226790126da16d50f608/lookups/baseline_historical_baseline.csv).
        
  5. searches:
      - Create and enable 'search_1', followed by 'search_2', followed by 'search_3'.
