description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to create a baseline of normal change activity. It 
            calculates the average and standard deviation of hourly changes to patient medical records 
            by staff members, grouped by unit or department. The resulting baseline is stored in the lookup 
            file baseline_change and is later used in the high_volume_of_changes_compared_to_peers detection 
            to detect individuals whose activity is unusually high compared to their peers.
