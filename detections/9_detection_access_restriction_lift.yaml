status: experimental
description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members who initiate the 
          lifting of an internal or external access restriction. A lift should only occur either 
          upon a patientâ€™s request or in emergency situations. This observation is informational, 
          although noteworthy, and should therefore be correlated with other observations to 
          validate its legitimacy.
