description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members who initiate the 
          lifting of an internal or external access restriction. A lift should only occur either 
          upon a patientâ€™s request or in emergency situations. It is important to correlate this type of
          activity with other observatinos to validate its legitimacy.
