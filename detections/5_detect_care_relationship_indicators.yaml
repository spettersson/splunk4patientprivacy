description: This search runs continuously to detect specific signals that indicate the existence of a legitimate care 
          relationship between staff members and patients. It can provide valuable input to whether recent activity
          is legimitate or not.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=medication OR tag=diagnostic OR tag=procedure  OR tag=condition OR tag=allergy
          | fields _time, user_id, patient_id, department_id, care_provider_id, type, subtype
scheduling:

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, action, object, object_change, type, subtype, department_id, and 
          care_provider_id, as well.
