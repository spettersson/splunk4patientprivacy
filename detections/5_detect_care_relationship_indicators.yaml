description: This search runs continuously to detect clinical signals that indicate a legitimate 
          care relationship between staff and patients. The results provide valuable evidence when 
          assessing whether a staff memberâ€™s access to patient records is legitimate.
data_source: EHR activity data

          (tag=diagnostic type=diagnostic_report status=completed) OR

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR activity data that has the tags medication, diagnostic, 
          procedure, and encounter. The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, care_unit_id, 
          care_provider_id, type, subtype, and status, as well.
