description: This search looks for specific signals that indicate the existence of a legitimate care relationship between 
          staff members and patients. It can provide valuable input to whether recent observations surroundings a staff member 
          is legimitate or not.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=auditevent tag=patientrecord (tag=prescription OR tag=diagnosis OR tag=encounter) earliest=-12min@min latest=-2min@min
          | fields _time, user_id, patient_id, care_provider_id, action, object, object_changes, type, subtype
          | stats count by user_id, patient_id, care_provider_id, action, object, object_changes, type, subtype
          | fields detection_*, observation_*, info_*, user_id, patient_id, care_provider_id, action, object*, type, subtype
how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, action, object, object_change, type, subtype, and 
          care_provider_id, as well.
