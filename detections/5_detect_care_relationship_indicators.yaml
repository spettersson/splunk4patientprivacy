description: This search runs continuously to detect specific signals that indicate the existence of a legitimate care 
          relationship between staff members and patients. It can provide valuable input to whether recent activity
          is legimitate or not.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=medication OR tag=diagnostic OR tag=procedure  OR tag=condition OR tag=allergy
          | fields user_id, patient_id, department_id, care_provider_id, type, subtype
