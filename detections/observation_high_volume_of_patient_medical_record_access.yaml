name: High Volume of Unique Patient Medical Record Access
type: Observation Triggering
description: This detections looks for staff members that access a high volume of distinct patient medical journals in 
          a short time period compared to their peers. For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in 
          index=observation_collection.
