name: Care Relationship Indicators
type: Observation Triggering
description: This detection looks for specific signals that (may) indicate the existence of a legitimate care relationship between 
          staff members and patients. It can provide valuable input to the decision whether a group of observations should trigger an alert or not, and also 
          be valuable when investigating alerts, helping to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. 
          For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation_collection.

prerequisites:
- data sources:
          EHR audit events from any source system
- tags:
          auditevent (explanation: identifies all EHR audit events, regardless of source system)
          patientrecord (explanation: identifies all EHR audit events associated with patient records access, regardless of source system)
          prescription (explanation: identifies EHR audit events where a users prescribes or orders medication for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          diagnosis (explanation: identifies EHR audit events where users adds/updates/removes a diagnosis for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          encounter (explanation: identifies EHR audit events tied to patient encounters, regardless of source system) 
- indexes: 
          observation (explanation: where identified observations are stored as individual events)
- fields (note: some fields will be present in the EHR audit events itself, others will be present by enriching the events with information from other sources): 
 	action (=type of action performed during the event - e.g., create, read, update, delete)
  	user_id (=identifier of the user who performed the action)
 	patient_id (=identifier of the patient whose medical record the action was performed on)
   	type (=high-level event category)
    	subtype (=more granular event description)
   	object (=human-readable name of what specifically was accessed)
    	object_changes (=attributes and values that were added, updated, or removed on the object)
  	care_provider_id (=identifier of the care provider associated with the event)
