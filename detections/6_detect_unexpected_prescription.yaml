description: This search runs continuously to detect staff members prescribing medication to patients without 
        evidence of prior clinical activity that would typically justify the prescription. It helps identify 
        potentially suspicious prescriptions issued without a recent encounter, diagnostic result, or documented 
        condition â€” signaling cases where a legitimate care relationship may be missing.
