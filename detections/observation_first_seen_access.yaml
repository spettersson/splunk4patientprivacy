name: First Seen Access
type: Observation Triggering
description: This detection looks for staff members who recently accessed a patient medical record
          without having any prior history with that patient in the last 6 months. For each match, 
          an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation.
detection_ID: obs1
author: Simon Pettersson, Splunk
prerequisites:
- data_sources: 
          EHR audit events from any source system
- tags:
          auditevents (=identifies all EHR audit events, regardless of source system)
          patientrecord (=identifies all EHR audit events associated with patient records access, regardless of source system)
- indexes: 
          observation (=an index where identified observations are stored as individual events)
- lookups: 
          baseline_historical_access (=a lookup file that stores the last seen access between employees and patients)
- fields: 
          user_id 
          work_unit_ID
          patient_id 
          care_unit_ID 
          care_provider_ID 
- searches: 
          search_1
          search_2
          search_3
how_to_implement:
  1. fields:
      - Make sure each individual EHR system has, at minimum, the following fields: user_id, patient_id
  2. indexes:
      - Make sure that an index with the name 'observation' exist.
      - The retention for this index should be configured according to your requirements/needs. 
  4. lookups:
      - Download and install Splunk App for Lookup File Editing (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724).
      - Create a KVstore lookup with the name 'baseline_historical_access' with the fields: user_id, patient_id, last_access. 
  5. searches:
      - Create and enable 'search_1', followed by 'search_2', followed by 'search_3'.
