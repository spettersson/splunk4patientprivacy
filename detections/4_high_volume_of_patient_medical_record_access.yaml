description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members that access a high volume of distinct patient 
          medical records in a short time period compared to their peers.
data_source: EHR audit data
search: tag=auditevent
          | fields user_id, patient_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | bin _time span=1h
          | stats dc(patient_id) as dc_patient by _time, user_id, work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | eventstats perc95(dc_patient) as perc95_dc_patient by work_unit_id, care_provider_id
          | where _time > relative_time(_time, "-1h")

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and medicalrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, work_unit_id, and care_provider_id, as well.
