description: Identifies staff members who accessed a patient medical record within the past 10-minute window 
          (accounting for a 2-minute latency) but has not accessed anything associated with that patient 
          in the last 6 months. This could indicate that there is no existing care relationship.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, and care_provider_id, as well. Moreover, in order for the search
          to work, the lookup file baseline_historical_access needs to be populated which is done via 1_baseline_backfill_first_seen_access
          and 1_baseline_first_seen_access.
