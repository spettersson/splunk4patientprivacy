description: This search runs continuously to detect staff members who accessed a specific 
          patientâ€™s medical record for the first time in 6 months. This could indicate that 
          there is no existing care relationship between the staff member and the patient.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and patientrecord. 
          The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, and care_provider_id, as well. Moreover, in order for the search
          to work, the lookup file baseline_historical_access needs to be populated which is done via 1_baseline_backfill_first_seen_access
          and 1_baseline_first_seen_access.
