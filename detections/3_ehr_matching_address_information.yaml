description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members who access patient medical records and have 
        address information matching that of the patient. A match on full address, street name, or postal code 
        may indicate a potential relationship outside of a professional context.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to ingest EHR audit data that has the tags auditevent and medicalrecord, and 
        identify data that provides the necessary address information. The data must have the fields user_id, patient_id, 
        care_unit_id, and care_provider_id, as well.
