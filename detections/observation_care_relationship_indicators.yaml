name: Care Relationship Indicators
type: Observation Triggering
description: This detection looks for specific signals that (may) indicate the existence of a legitimate care relationship between 
          medical staff and patients. It can provide valuable input to the decision whether a group of observations should trigger an alert or not, and also 
          be valuable when investigating alerts, helping to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. 
          For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation_collection.

author: Simon Pettersson, Splunk
prerequisites:
- data sources:
          EHR audit events from any source system
- tags:
          auditevent (explanation: identifies all EHR audit events, regardless of source system)
          patientrecord (explanation: identifies all EHR audit events associated with patient records access, regardless of source system)
          prescription (explanation: identifies EHR audit events where a users prescribes or orders medication for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          diagnosis (explanation: identifies EHR audit events where users adds/updates/removes a diagnosis for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          encounter (explanation: identifies EHR audit events tied to patient encounters, regardless of source system) 
- indexes: 
          observation (explanation: where identified observations are stored as individual events)
- fields (note: some fields will be present in the EHR audit events itself, others will be present by enriching the events with information from other sources): 
	user_id (who performed the action)
 	action (CRUD-like indicator: read, update, create, delete)
 	patient_id (who the action was performed on)
   	type (high-level event category)
    	subtype (more granular event details)
   	object (human-readable name of what was accessed)
    	object_attributes
  	care_provider_id
