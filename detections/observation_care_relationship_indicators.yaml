name: care relationship indicators
type: observation-triggering
description: 
          This detection looks for specific signals that may indicate the existence of a legitimate care relationship between 
          an employee and a patient. While it does not represent suspicious behavior, it can provide valuable input to the logic used to group
          observations to surface alerts, and also be valuable when investigating alerts, helping to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
          For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation_collection.
