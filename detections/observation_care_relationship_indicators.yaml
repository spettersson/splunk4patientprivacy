name: Care Relationship Indicators
type: Observation-triggering
description: This detection looks for specific signals that may indicate the existence of a legitimate care relationship between 
          an employee and a patient. While it does not represent suspicious behavior, it can provide valuable input to the logic used to group
          observations to surface alerts, and also be valuable when investigating alerts, helping to distinguish between acceptable and 
          unacceptable behaviour. For each match, an observation is created and stored as an event in index=observation_collection.
detection_ID: obs5
prerequisites:
- data sources:
          EMR audit logs
- indexes: 
          observation_collection (=where identified observations are stored as individual events)
- fields: 
          staff_ID
          patient_ID
          action
          target_type
          clinical_event_type
          care_provider_ID
- tags:
          emraudit (=identifies all EMR audit logs, regardless of source system)
          prescription (=identifies EMR audit logs where a staff member prescribes or orders medication for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          diagnosis (=identifies EMR audit logs where a staff member adds/updates/removes a diagnosis for a patient, regardless of source system) 
          encounter (=identifies EMR audit logs tied to patient encounters, including outpatient visits, inpatient admissions, or consultations, regardless of source system)
