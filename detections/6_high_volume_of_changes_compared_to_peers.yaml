description: This search runs on a scheduled basis to detect staff members who make 
            an unusually high number of hourly changes to patient medical records, compared to 
            their peers within the same unit or department. This is done by leveraging the 
            baseline created by baseline_high_volume_of_changes_compared_to_peers.
