name: unusual access hours
type: anomaly-triggering
description: looks for employees accessing patient medical records during unusual hours of the day, based on their own historical behavior. Access is considered unusual if it occurs during an hour that is rare or not previously observed for the individual staff member. For each match, an anomaly is triggered.
