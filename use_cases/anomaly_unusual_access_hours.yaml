name: unusual access hours
type: anomaly-triggering
description: looks for employees accessing patient medical records during unusual hours of the day, based on their own historical access pattern. Access is considered unusual if it occurs during an hour that is rare or not previously observed for the individual staff member. For each match, an anomaly is triggered.

prerequisites: 
- indexes: 
          anomaly_collection
- lookups: 
          baseline_access_hours
- macros: 
- fields:

how_to_implement:

search_1: 
- description: This search analyzes audit logs from the past 30 days to build a baseline of access hours for each staff member. It identifies the least commonly used hours (rare) by staff_ID and stores the results in a lookup table (baseline_access_hours) to be used in search_2 to detect anomalies.
- search: 
 tag=emraudit staff_ID=* patient_ID=* earliest=-30d
 | fields _time, staff_ID
 | eval hourOfDay = strptime(_time, "%H")
 | rare hourOfDay by staff_ID
 | fields staff_ID, hourOfDay, percent
 | outputlookup baseline_access_hours
- time range picker: N/A (the time window for the search is defined in the search itself via the earliest and latest options).
- cron schedule: * * * * *

search_2: 
- description: This search runs continuously to detect accesses to patient records during hours that are unusual for the staff member, based on the baseline built by search_1. If an access occurs at a rare or previously unseen hour (percent ≤ 1 or null), an anomaly is created and stored in the index=anomaly_collection.
