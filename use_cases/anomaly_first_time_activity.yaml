name: First time activity
type: Anomaly-triggering
description:
  This use case identifies employees who recently engaged in activity related to a patient 
  without having any prior history of activity in the last 6 months.
use_case_ID: 'uc1'
prerequisites:
- data_sources: 
    Events from any journal system that records access to patient journals.
- tags:
    journalaccess (explanation: a tag that references all events, despite data source, that falls into the category of journal records)
- indexes: 
    anomaly_collection (explanation: An index where identified anomalies are stored as events.)
- lookups: 
    baseline_historical_activity (a lookup file that stores the last recorded activity between employees and patients in a key-value format.)
- fields: 
    staff_ID (a unique identifier for the employee.)
    patient_ID (a unique identifier for the patient.)
    care_provider_ID (a unique identifier for the care provider.)
    care_unit_ID (a unique identifier for the care unit at the care provider.)
- searches: 
    search_1
    search_2
    search_3

how_to_implement:

  1. fields:
      - Make sure each individual journal system has the following fields: staff_ID, patient_ID, care_provider_ID, care_unit_ID.
      - Please check the 'Fields' section in data guidelines for more detailed information about how to set this up, which can be found here 
        https://github.com/spettersson/splunk4patientprivacy/blob/main/data_guidelines.md.

  2. event types:
      - Make sure each individual journal system has its own unique event type, with all event types referencing the tag 'journalaccess'. 
        Please check the 'Event types' section in the data guidelines for more detailed information about how to set this up, which can be found here
        https://github.com/spettersson/splunk4patientprivacy/blob/main/data_guidelines.md).

  3. indexes:
      - Make sure that an index with the name 'anomaly_collection' exist.
      - The retention for this index should be configured according to your requirements/needs. 
      
  4. lookups:
      - Download and install Splunk App for Lookup File Editing (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724).
      - Import the lookup baseline_historical_activity.csv 
        (https://github.com/spettersson/splunk4patientprivacy/blob/cc1ba2159eadc166eee0226790126da16d50f608/lookups/baseline_historical_baseline.csv).
        
  5. searches:
      - Create and enable 'search_1', followed by 'search_2', followed by 'search_3'.
