prerequisites: 
- indexes: 
          anomaly_collection (explanation: an index where identified anomalies are stored as events)
          incident_collection (explanation: an index where identified incidents are stored as events)
- lookups: 
- macros: 
- fields: 
          title
          description
          staff_ID

- searches: 
          search 1
how_to_implement:
          1. create an index called 'anomaly_collection' and 'incident_collection'. 
          5. create 'search 1' as a report and then schedule it according to the instructions.
